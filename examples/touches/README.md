##How to run touches example

```../hyperloop-cli/bin/hyperloop clean compile package launch --platform=android --src=examples/touches --skip-ir --sdk=19```

Please note that --sdk accepts an sdk level. We are using 19 in this example.
Skip IR isn't required, but for the time being is not a bad idea either.
